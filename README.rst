Pseudo-Spectral Fluid Dynamics in Python
========================================

This package contains some simple tools for writing fluid-dynamics solvers using pseudo-spectral methods.  The basic structure of the package is closely patterned on the spectral DNS code of Mortensen and Langtangen, which can be found `here <https://github.com/spectralDNS/spectralDNS>`_ and is described `here <http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.03638v1.pdf>`_.  That package requires a substantial software stack, and is built on a generic spectral Galerkin package, which makes it more difficult to tinker with.  This package is designed to be a transparent and easy to modify as possible, for use as a research code.

Documentation
-------------

PsDNS has a `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ manual, including
detailed documentation of the API.  In order to build the manual,
Sphinx needs access to the internet (to link to dependency packages)
and to be able to load the ``psdns`` source code (to access Python
docstrings).

To build the documentation from a fresh checkout of the code, first
make sure your Python environment is set to one that includes all the
dependencies for PsDNS (i.e., one from which you can successully run
the examples) and then type::
  
  cd doc
  PYTHONPATH=../psdns make html

for HTML documentation, or for PDF::

  PYTHONPATH=../psdns make latexpdf

Examples
--------

Example scripts can be found in the ``examples`` directory.
